# Customer Churn Prediction – Project Report

## 1. Introduction
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time.  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Machine Learning techniques to help businesses retain valuable customers.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Businesses often lose customers without understanding the reason.  
The goal of this project is to:
- Identify customers likely to churn  
- Help businesses take preventive actions  
- Improve customer retention strategies  

---

## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Customer ID  
- Customer State  
- Transaction-related features  

The data is stored in CSV format and processed using Python.

---

## 4. Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control

---

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:
- Understand data distribution  
- Identify missing values  
- Analyze customer behavior  

Key steps:
- Data loading  
- Checking null values  
- Visualizing customer distribution by state  

---

## 6. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was performed to:
- Convert categorical data into numerical form  
- Create meaningful input features for the model  

Example:
- `customer_state` → numerical encoding  
- Created a target column `churn`

---

## 7. Model Building
A **Random Forest Classifier** was used for training.

Reasons:
- Handles non-linear data well  
- Reduces overfitting  
- Provides good accuracy  

---

## 8. Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

These metrics help measure model performance.

---

## 9. Results
- Model successfully predicts customer churn  
- Provides probability-based predictions  
- Helps identify high-risk customers  

---

## 10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for customer churn prediction.  
It can be further improved using more data, advanced models, and real-time prediction systems.

---

## 11. Future Improvements
- Add real-time prediction API  
- Integrate dashboard visualization  
- Improve feature engineering
